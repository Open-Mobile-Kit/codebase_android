# Introduction to the Android Codebase

Welcome to the advanced Android codebase documentation. This document provides a high-level overview of the project's architecture, patterns, and best practices. It's designed to help you get up to speed quickly and contribute effectively.

## 🚀 Project Philosophy

This codebase is built on a foundation of modern Android development principles, emphasizing:

-   **Clean Architecture**: Separating concerns into distinct layers (UI, Domain, Data) to create a more maintainable and testable application.
-   **Reactivity and Unidirectional Data Flow**: Using reactive streams and a BLoC pattern to manage state in a predictable way.
-   **Type Safety**: Leveraging Kotlin's type system to catch errors at compile time, especially in areas like navigation.
-   **Modularity**: Encouraging the development of self-contained features that are easy to reason about and reuse.

## 📂 App Structure

To get a detailed understanding of how the project is organized, including the different layers and their responsibilities, please refer to the [App Structure Guide](app_structure.md).

## 🏛️ Core Architectural Components

The architecture is built around three main pillars:

### 1. BLoC for State Management

We use a BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, inspired by `flutter_bloc`. This pattern provides a clear separation between the UI and the business logic.

-   **Events**: Represent user actions or other inputs.
-   **States**: Represent the state of the UI.
-   **BLoCs**: Receive events, process them, and emit new states.
-   **Side Effects**: Handle one-time actions like showing toasts or navigating.

For a detailed guide on how to implement and use BLoCs, please refer to the [BLoC Implementation Guide](bloc_implementation.md).

### 2. Type-Safe Navigation

Navigation is handled by a custom type-safe navigation system that uses guards to control access to different parts of the app.

-   **`AppRoute`**: Defines the screen's routes in your application in a type-safe way.
-   **`NavigationCommand`**: Represents the different navigation actions (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `replace`).
-   **`NavigationGuard`**: Allows you to protect routes with specific conditions (e.g., checking if a user is logged in).

For more information on how to use the navigation system, see the [Navigation Implementation Guide](navigation_implementation.md).

### 3. Screen Implementation

We have a standardized way of building screens that combines a contract, a BLoC, and a Composable UI.

-   **Contract**: Defines the `Event`, `State`, and `SideEffect` for a given screen.
-   **BLoC**: Implements the business logic for the screen.
-   **Screen**: A Composable function that displays the UI based on the current state and sends events to the BLoC.

To learn more about building screens, please read the [Screen Implementation Guide](screen_implementation.md).

## 🧪 Testing

We encourage writing unit tests for BLoCs and other business logic, as well as integration tests for more complex user flows. (Further documentation on testing strategies is forthcoming).
